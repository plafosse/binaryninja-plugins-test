# Binary Ninja Plugins

Repository to track Binary Ninja Plugins, Themes, and other related tools

## Plugins

Binary Ninja plugins are available in different channels. Currently, there are two channels:

 - [Official](plugins/official): The official channel includes plugins written directly by [Vector 35](https://vector35.com/) or written by a third-party and verified by Vector 35. We have at least done our best to ensure they use the current plugin writing best-practices and provide useful functionality.

 - [Community](plugins/community): The community channel includes plugins written by third-parties that are not verified for quality, safety, or efficacy.  

 - [Combined](plugins/): A combined list of all plugins.

A [sample plugin](plugins/official/sample_plugin/) is available to demonstrate the required format for plugins.
